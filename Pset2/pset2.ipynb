    "Download the dataset from [here](https://goo.gl/oZVxEa), unzip it and put `dblp_authors.npz`  and `dblp_graph.npz` in the same folder with this notebook. Each value (author name) from `dblp_authors.npz` corresponds to the row/column of the matrix from `dblp_graph.npz`. Value at row `i` and column `j` of the matrix from `dblp_graph.npz` corresponds to the number of times author `i` cited papers of the author `j`. Let us now find the most significant scientists according to PageRank model over DBLP data.\n",

Find top-10 most cited authors from the weighted adjacency matrix. Now, make all the weights of the adjacency matrix equal to 1 for simplicity (consider only existence of connection between authors, not its weight). Obtain the PageRank matrix $A$ from the adjacency matrix and verify that it is stochastic.\n",
